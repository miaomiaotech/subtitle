1
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,260
The only way you can change
the world is with stories.

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,517
{\an8}And the bigger your legend becomes,

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,602
the easier it is to share the story.

4
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,730
People want to hear it.

5
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,856
They want to listen.

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,735
<i>Winds to
35 knots or higher possible.</i>

7
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:27,902
<i>And thunderstorms.</i>

8
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,992
<i>Showers and thunderstorms.</i>

9
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,994
We are in an environmental emergency.

10
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,751
And having this vessel out there
telling these stories is

11
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,003
actually a really hopeful and inspiring.

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,017
It looks like somebody just
dropped a fricking

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,477
chandelier right on the ocean.

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,770
Yeah.

15
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:05,356
You don't realize the size
and the scale of this oil rig.

16
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,941
It's a floating city.

17
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,195
Now we're on this mission to chase big oil

18
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,279
out of the Bahamas.

19
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,157
Just using our cameras.

20
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,869
All right, this is it.

21
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,388
{\an8}

22
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,265
Starboard bow.

23
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,227
This one is big and blue.
You can't miss it.

24
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,354
- It's huge.
- It's huge, yeah.

25
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:53,071
35 feet deep, 34 feet deep, 50, 48.

26
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,323
What's down there?

27
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,120
306, 48 to 306.

28
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,371
So I think we should explore right here.

29
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,705
It looks really great.

30
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,833
I don't worry about him.
He worries about me.

31
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,043
Got to worry about something.

32
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,586
Might as well be the love of my life.

33
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,714
I think we are going to spend

34
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,675
the rest of our lives
trying to save the ocean.

35
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,594
If anybody's uncomfortable,
they call the dive.

36
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,096
- We go up together.
- Okay.

37
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,974
It's so difficult to photograph
and film in the ocean.

38
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,392
Not many people can do it.

39
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,354
And until we cannot physically do it,

40
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,231
we're going to continue doing it.

41
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,818
<i>National Geographic Magazine</i>

42
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,404
<i>is revealing its adventurers of the year.</i>

43
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,281
<i>They are chosen for
embodying the spirit of</i>

44
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,575
<i>adventure in groundbreaking ways.</i>

45
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,910
<i>Two of them did so as a couple,</i>

46
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,788
<i>Paul Nicklen and Cristina Mittermeier
are photographers.</i>

47
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,458
<i>They met in the cafeteria
of National Geographic's headquarters.</i>

48
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,669
<i>Their dramatic images
of the natural world have</i>

49
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,130
<i>won millions of social media followers,</i>

50
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,133
<i>turning them into conservation superstars.</i>

51
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,552
<i>While Paul specializes in wildlife</i>

52
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:01,055
<i>at the frozen ends of the earth,
Cristina captures the lives of</i>

53
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,933
<i>indigenous people all over the world.</i>

54
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,728
<i>In 2015,
the two marine biologists</i>

55
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,605
<i>cofounded SeaLegacy.</i>

56
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,025
<i>A non-profit organization
working to save our seas.</i>

57
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,070
In the beginning
all we had was our Instagram account.

58
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,407
People really want to know
what it feels like to be a photographer.

59
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,744
What it feels like to be
sitting there in the stream

60
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,329
when a bear comes walking in.

61
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,581
I was cold. I was hungry.

62
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,416
I was scared. I was excited.

63
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,878
And so, we started posting those stories.

64
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,880
And it was like a scene out
of <i>Forest Gump.</i>

65
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,548
One day you look behind you

66
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,425
and there's thousands of people
following you.

67
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,843
Millions of people following you.

68
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,221
I really see the journey
we're going on is to be

69
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:45,183
a Jacques Cousteau 2.0
using modern technology.

70
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,893
Beating that drum constantly.

71
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,939
You can elicit an emotional
response from your followers.

72
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,274
You can make them care.
You can make them angry.

73
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,944
I just want them to feel it
and then from there,

74
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,278
decide what they want to do.

75
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,613
I think a lot of people have

76
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,490
already given up, you know?

77
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,117
Why care if everything is already doomed?

78
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,620
We still live in a beautiful planet.

79
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,748
There are still so many
amazing animals out there.

80
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,626
I want to be an ambassador for nature.

81
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,710
For all of us.

82
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,128
For my children for yours.

83
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,756
{\an8}And so, making that connection

84
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,091
{\an8}from here's a photograph to

85
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,510
{\an8}here's how we begin a movement
of people who care.

86
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,689
{\an8}A couple of nights of traveling, sailing,

87
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,190
{\an8}living with Paul Nicklen.

88
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,651
Don't do it.

89
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,903
All right, this is where the makeup lives.

90
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,615
And all we need to do to
be presentable for Instagram

91
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,700
is use this mirror.

92
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,784
Oh God...

93
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,954
It's a disaster.

94
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:52,625
{\an8}We're off to a place in the Bahamas
that has pristine waters,

95
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,335
rich abundance of wildlife,

96
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,920
great populations of sharks.

97
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,673
We're getting probably
anywhere from 10 to 20 emails

98
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,133
and texts a day saying,

99
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,468
"Help! We have a major issue."

100
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,138
Everywhere you look, you hear
screams of help for the environment.

101
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,932
This is nice. This is better.

102
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,434
These are all
these little simmering issues

103
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,643
that are going on in the world.

104
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,771
And <i>SeaLegacy</i> has become so big
that we can just now go into

105
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,690
and just throw gasoline on
these little simmering fires.

106
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,860
Our hope is to take this boat
around the world

107
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,904
and help tell the stories that
need to be told everywhere.

108
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,161
This is like the adventure of a lifetime.

109
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,499
And when we bought this boat
we basically didn't know

110
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,751
where to start.

111
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,921
And we could have thrown a dart
at a globe and landed anywhere,

112
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:43,009
but it is very difficult not
to fall in love with a place

113
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,093
like the Bahamas.

114
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,721
It's like candy.

115
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,097
It's gorgeous.

116
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,474
There's beautiful wildlife,

117
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,225
there's dolphins, there's sharks.

118
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,437
It's a stronghold for
many endangered species.

119
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:00,443
But now they have an opportunity
to drill for oil.

120
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,738
There's a shallow shoal
and there's a company called

121
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,657
the <i>Stena IceMAX</i> that
has applied for permit.

122
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,243
And we know what can happen

123
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,371
when big companies drill for oil.

124
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,375
And so, our story in
the Bahamas is this moment,

125
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,793
this crossroads.

126
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,670
You know, <i>SeaLegacy</i> is for the fish,

127
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,589
and we are for the whales
and for the dolphins.

128
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,592
So, our job in the Bahamas
is to remind people that this

129
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,927
is all still there.

130
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,970
But you have to protect it.

131
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,183
And if we can make that
happen here in the Bahamas,

132
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,186
then we can make it
happen elsewhere on the planet.

133
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,479
So, we have to succeed.

134
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,818
So, we know
where the <i>IceMAX</i> is based on

135
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,902
marine traffic,

136
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,612
'cause they've been at it
for almost two months.

137
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,490
My understanding is that
they only have 12 days left.

138
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,409
At some point, a dolphin is
going to wash up on a beach.

139
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,576
A whale is going to die from this.

140
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,661
Something is going to happen.

141
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,287
{\an8}So, here's our plan.

142
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,081
{\an8}First, we're going to photograph

143
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,333
{\an8}the giant seagrass beds
that were just discovered.

144
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,961
{\an8}Then we're going to sail
looking for big marine animals,

145
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,504
{\an8}the whales, the sharks,

146
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,423
{\an8}and finally, we're going to
make our way around

147
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,799
{\an8}the northern tip of Andros

148
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:05,967
{\an8}and sail through the night

149
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,678
{\an8}to get to the oil rig under
the cover of darkness.

150
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,971
{\an8}Great!

151
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,391
So A, we're going
to have the biggest body of work

152
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,769
ever created for the Bahamas
underwater and above

153
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,231
that showcase the beauty
of this place and to contrast that

154
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,233
we're going to have Goliath.

155
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,818
Yeah.

156
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,069
But first, let's get some epic,

157
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,654
beautiful footage.

158
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,513
When I'm shooting, I like to think

159
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,515
about myself like a membrane.

160
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,482
And on one side you have
the thing that I'm photographing,

161
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,817
and let it pass through that membrane,

162
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,528
{\an8}people that will never
put their head underwater.

163
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,410
I want to be where that conversation goes

164
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,495
back and forth.

165
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,499
I love it, I just can't get enough of it.

166
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,425
I remember my dad coming home from work.

167
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,302
We were still living in Mexico City,

168
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,721
so my brother must have been eight or nine

169
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,097
and I was probably six or seven

170
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,934
and I was already fascinated by the ocean.

171
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,477
You know, I just loved it.

172
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,605
And he brought home a book and he had like

173
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,940
wrapped in newspaper.

174
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,149
He opened it up and it was

175
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,401
<i>Jacques Cousteau, The Underwater World</i>

176
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,153
and he gave it to Freddy.

177
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,697
And I was like, "Why to Freddy?"

178
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,325
You know, "I'm the one
who cares about this stuff."

179
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,329
To this day, I cannot fathom
that my dad never even saw it.

180
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,873
You know, that, that the gift was
lost on Freddy.

181
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,668
I would just sneak into
my brother's bedroom

182
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,044
after he got bored with it.

183
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,046
And you know, I would look,
I still have the book.

184
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,800
I think we do this to girls.

185
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,052
You know, we raised
them to believe that somehow

186
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,429
opportunities are better given to boys,

187
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,765
that some things are not for girls.

188
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,849
I grew up like that.

189
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,270
So many of my girlfriends,
equally interesting,

190
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,897
equally curious, they did nothing

191
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,440
but stay home and become housewives.

192
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,150
That was the expectation.

193
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,610
I remember my dad saying, you know,

194
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,572
"Who's going to want to marry you
if you go work on a fishing boat?"

195
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,741
Who's going to want to marry you?

196
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,993
Really?

197
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,664
I was able to redeem myself years later,

198
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,667
you know, I went to
University in Northern Mexico.

199
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,627
I wanted to be a marine biologist,

200
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,796
but the only thing they had
was fisheries biology.

201
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,173
That sounded close enough to me.

202
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,678
So, I graduated with
my dad in my ear saying,

203
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,390
"You know, biology, how are
you going to make a living?

204
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,766
It's not for girls."

205
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,270
And a friend of mine
had an uncle who owned

206
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,439
a hotel in Akumal.

207
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,651
And so I moved to the Yucatan
and I spent probably a year.

208
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,945
I mean, I had all the diving I wanted

209
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,739
because the hotel had a little dive shop.

210
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,116
So every day I would go
diving and then I would just

211
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,327
go in the jungle and chase the monkeys.

212
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,162
And towards the end of the year,

213
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,288
there was a hurricane.

214
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,374
Scientists came through the hotel
and they stayed there

215
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,542
and they offered me a job.

216
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,668
Conservation International.

217
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:33,716
And so I moved back to Mexico City
and I started working in conservation.

218
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,884
Can you imagine?

219
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,516
{\an8}You know, I think
our goal is to do a wildlife

220
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,103
and nature biodiversity cross-section
of the entire Bahamas.

221
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,105
And one of the great announcements that,

222
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,775
I mean, this is secret, um,
hasn't been announced yet,

223
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,735
but the biggest seagrass beds
in the world,

224
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,153
underwater seagrass beds.

225
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:58,074
They are discovered here in
the Bahamas and they are by far

226
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,200
the largest in the world.

227
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,951
It's the biggest
scientific discovery

228
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,536
in the oceans in the last 10 years.

229
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,330
And it's on the banks here?

230
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,915
Right, right south of Nassau.

231
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,041
Yeah.

232
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,379
If you go to the Bahamas
you think of the beautiful ripples

233
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,297
of white on the sand, on the ocean floor,

234
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,385
the crystal blue clear water.

235
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,180
So, if I said to somebody.

236
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,640
"Wow, you should care about seagrass,"

237
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,058
they'd be like, "Yeah okay, whatever,

238
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,393
I'm tuned out already," right?

239
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,318
But if you can go down
underwater and connect

240
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,611
this whole ecosystem

241
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,740
from eagle rays and stingrays.

242
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,285
To following a shark through the seagrass

243
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,914
and she does this spiral move
to get rid of the remoras

244
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:51,043
that are attached to her,
you see all these species

245
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,878
that are connected to this environment.

246
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,632
And you realize how important it is.

247
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:02,972
And you use this beautiful
engaging mega-fauna to get

248
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,558
{\an8}people to ultimately
fall in love with grass.

249
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,642
{\an8}It's big and lush

250
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,519
{\an8}and it really feels like
an underwater garden.

251
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,689
{\an8}Seagrass is actually

252
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,023
{\an8}the oldest living organism

253
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,108
on our planet.

254
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,736
CO2 carbon goes in.

255
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,237
Oxygen gets spit out.

256
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,031
Those are the lungs of the Bahamas.

257
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,325
So whenever someone says,

258
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,578
"Every second breath
you take comes from the sea."

259
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,288
That's what we're talking about.

260
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:32,918
I just don't think we appreciate

261
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,047
the importance of little things
like the roots of the seagrass.

262
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,719
Doesn't look like much,
but they might just be the solution.

263
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,305
You want the secret,

264
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,724
well, nature has been doing
it for four billion years.

265
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,851
You're going to put that
at risk so four or five guys

266
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:49,935
can get rich on oil.

267
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,357
From where we're trying to
head is where the <i>Stena IceMAX</i>

268
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,734
is down right here.

269
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,986
People are like,
"Well drilling's in the deep water."

270
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,113
Well so are the whales, you know.

271
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,241
People don't realize the power
of the most sophisticated

272
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,036
oil drilling at the biggest scale,

273
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,538
right in the middle
of a whale migratory corridor,

274
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,582
if there was an oil spill in that area.

275
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,918
Oh it would all go
and wash up in Florida.

276
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,795
That oil
would go right instantly into

277
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,755
the Gulf Stream
it would be along the entire

278
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,965
eastern seaboard of the United States.

279
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,888
Okay, pull on that sucker.

280
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:26,972
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

281
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,974
A little more.

282
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,228
<i>How are you?</i>

283
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,813
I'm great! How are you?

284
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,442
<i>I'm fine,
I'm looking out at the snow.</i>

285
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,110
<i>It's about 6 inches.</i>

286
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,656
<i>So, I'm looking at what
boots I'm gonna wear, and you?</i>

287
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,907
Uh, yeah,
we're doing great.

288
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,951
Just wanted to check in
and just tell you we love you

289
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,119
and we think about you guys often and, uh,

290
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,746
find ourselves homesick, but...

291
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,872
<i>Well, the same here.</i>

292
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,249
Yeah, well, thank you for everything.

293
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,585
<i>I love you very much.</i>

294
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,379
<i>And you look after yourselves, OK?</i>

295
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,381
<i>Call me. I like that
every once in a while.</i>

296
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,465
<i>It's so nice.</i>

297
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,509
Yes, we will
for sure and give my love

298
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,636
to Aaron and Mark and, uh,
the puppies, of course.

299
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,847
And, and we'll talk to you soon, Mom.

300
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,139
- <i>Will do.</i>
- Okay.

301
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,432
<i>OK, I love you. Take care.</i>

302
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,934
Okay.
Love you too, okay bye-bye.

303
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,774
In 1972, when I was four years old,

304
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,818
my family moved to Baffin Island

305
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,278
because my dad got a job there.

306
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,572
It's a three-and-a-half-hour flight

307
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,657
on the big jet straight north.

308
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,786
We had moved into a community
of 190 Inuit people.

309
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,455
There are all these outpost camps,

310
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,541
your groceries came once a year by ship.

311
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,792
We didn't have a television.

312
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,043
We didn't have a radio.

313
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,503
We didn't even have a telephone.

314
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,629
Nobody had a telephone.

315
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,424
It was a strange place,
but I just got off on it.

316
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,510
And it was a very simple,

317
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:51,599
but very raw,
but very beautiful existence.

318
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,479
In our little town of Lake Harbour,

319
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,191
my mom had a little dark room.

320
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:05,029
She would take pictures,
she would process her negatives

321
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,280
in this bath.

322
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,741
And you would see these
beautiful moments of these

323
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,410
Inuit hunters just, you know,
people out on the land

324
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,246
and black and whites and us kids.

325
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:21,503
It's my only really sort of
sad moment in all of this is

326
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,006
that my mom had such a hardship
living in the North.

327
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,760
She saw so much troubling stuff
that when she came out of the Arctic,

328
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,720
she took her life's work.

329
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,972
All of her photography,
all of her slides...

330
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,984
She took this whole journey
we were on and just burned it.

331
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,819
She took gasoline and just burned it all.

332
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,114
And she wanted to

333
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,869
remove that chapter
from her life whereas I,

334
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,289
you know, I found myself
dreaming about the Arctic

335
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,249
and pursuing going back to the Arctic.

336
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,378
And being back with my Inuit friends.

337
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,630
I deeply fell in love with this place.

338
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:21,689
{\an8}

339
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,025
Let's do 10:00.

340
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,908
Definitely hear something down there.

341
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,034
Go to two.

342
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,496
Go nine.

343
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,832
{\an8}I thought
it was just the microphone,

344
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,333
{\an8}but it disappears it like...

345
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,668
{\an8}
Exactly, I think that static is

346
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,877
{\an8}I think whales deep.

347
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,339
So it's working, which is the good news.

348
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,966
If those are whales,
they'd be then six, seven,

349
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,342
eight miles away.

350
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,095
I think we'll just go
another one-mile north.

351
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,179
Can I listen?

352
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,639
Mm-hmm.

353
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,607
Oh, wow. Amazing.

354
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,569
That noise
we're hearing is that way.

355
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,695
- ...or something.
- Okay.

356
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,030
- The danger distance.
- Yeah.

357
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,073
He likes the cold,

358
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,742
but he also likes the blue water.

359
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,911
Paul Nicklen is happiest
when he has a big animal that

360
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,413
he can just spend time with.

361
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,915
Okay, I'm launching the drone.

362
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,468
Shelton, I'm going to do a big arch to

363
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,761
port and come around.

364
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,345
Okay, yeah, I'm scoping the whole area.

365
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,430
I can't see them.

366
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,141
Shelton
is on top and he's got the drone

367
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,392
in the air.

368
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,936
Mishe is in the bow,
she's looking for fins.

369
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,064
And somehow I got stuck in the wheel,

370
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,191
but somebody has to drive, so.

371
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,568
Yeah,
you can see that really well.

372
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,445
Yeah, oh they're
surfaced, they're on the top.

373
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,822
They're
about 300 feet off the bow.

374
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,034
As best I can tell
it's just a pod of pilot whales.

375
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,953
180 honey, let's do it.

376
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,164
Last light of the day.

377
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,084
Turn off the engine, just
press the big black stop button.

378
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,002
Okay. We're stopped.

379
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,713
- Okay going in.
- Good luck!

380
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,216
I've always
been so in love with being

381
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,384
immersed in the ocean.

382
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,718
I'm with a wild animal.

383
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,558
I think it was second-year university,

384
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,519
one night I'm waiting
for a friend to go study

385
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,020
and I click on the TV for a second.

386
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,648
<i>But here the water is clear</i>

387
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,442
<i>and the orcas linger near us.</i>

388
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,611
It's these
two divers in the water.

389
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,698
And these orcas come up to them
and then swim around them.

390
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,658
And the orcas disappear into the depths.

391
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,076
<i>Disappear into the haze below us,</i>

392
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,452
<i>as if departing.</i>

393
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,289
Then they come back up
each with a shark in their mouths.

394
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,957
<i>She parades before us like</i>

395
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,418
<i>a cat proudly displaying a mouse.</i>

396
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,129
And they circle around
Jacques Cousteau and his team,

397
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,255
and then disappear.

398
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,339
And I was just like,

399
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,425
"That's what I'm going to
do for the rest of my life.

400
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,135
I know exactly what I'm going to do.
That's it."

401
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,557
From that minute on, I was obsessed.

402
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,642
I was all in.

403
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,312
I was failing almost every class.

404
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,814
And I, I just basically lived underwater.

405
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,110
I just took down my camera
and I shot and I shot and I shot

406
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,487
three to four times a day, every day

407
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,823
and my bedroom was
full with wet dive gear.

408
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,909
And it was just foul.

409
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,368
But I didn't care.

410
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,704
Because I was just dove,
dove every second I could.

411
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,543
I remember I went home.

412
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,754
My neighbor was a photographer
and he's like,

413
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,547
"Let's do a slideshow at my house."

414
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,507
I was so proud, you know,

415
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,427
and I put these pictures up on
the wall and, and my dad said,

416
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,971
"I think this is an absolute waste
of time and money.

417
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,765
Why would you waste your
time doing this?" You know?

418
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,933
And I was just like, "Ugh."

419
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,310
The hardest part was emotionally.

420
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,896
I think everybody telling me,

421
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,732
including my parents,
my friends, my coworkers,

422
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,816
"You are going to fail."

423
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,445
And so I was mad at the world
for telling me that

424
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,529
I couldn't do this.

425
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:46,161
So I packed up my gear
and I went to a pilot and I said,

426
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,957
"I need you to drop me off
as far away from civilization as you can."

427
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,042
And I said, "If I'm alive in four months,

428
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,086
I will be at the Arctic Ocean.

429
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,213
I'm just going to live
out here alone with animals."

430
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,093
Took 300 rolls of film.

431
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,763
And I remember standing
on the Barren Lands after

432
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,056
probably a week of being there.

433
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,724
I was lonely. I kind of wanted to go home.

434
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,850
Like, "What the hell am I doing?"

435
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,602
And, "Everybody's right, I am a failure."

436
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,521
And I remember just screaming one day

437
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,897
until my lungs were just raw.

438
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,193
And it was after that,
that I sort of just settled in.

439
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,196
And I went from that,
to being almost panicked that

440
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,531
this trip wasn't long enough.

441
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,908
I only had three months left,
and I had to make

442
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:25,993
every second count.

443
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,744
And, you know, I lost 50 pounds.

444
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,413
I kind of became like a wild animal.

445
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,164
You know, I could see forever,

446
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,250
like your senses become so in tune that

447
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,211
it became like this drug to
be out there in, in nature.

448
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,422
And when the trip was wrapping up,

449
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:42,259
I was just horrified,
sad that it had to end, you know?

450
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,430
My now ex-wife came in
for the last two weeks of the trip and,

451
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,641
you know, it was, uh,
I remember being very frustrated

452
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,976
with her that she couldn't see,
like, I'm like,

453
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,103
"The muskoxen are right
there in front of you."

454
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,938
And they were like
probably seven miles away.

455
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,565
She kept saying, "I can't see them."

456
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,860
That was kind of my,

457
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,738
my transition into the next chapter
of life.

458
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,990
Just to use all that I had
learned from the Inuit

459
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:09,536
and my survival skills and to
just think about life, what was next.

460
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,372
He's a very good outdoorsman.

461
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,166
He's a very good survivalist.

462
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,252
And that allows him to do something that

463
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,962
a lot of photographers can't do.

464
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,965
And that is showing us intimate nature.

465
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,844
So for him, it's not
enough to have a telephoto lens

466
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,637
and be 200 feet away.

467
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,182
He has to be this close.

468
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,810
{\an8}I've never been
naive enough to think

469
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,480
{\an8}that I have special relationship
with animals.

470
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:41,318
But I do believe there's a wildness to me
from spending so much time with them

471
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,819
that I give off an energy

472
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,529
and a vibe around them.

473
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,617
That they can work with it.

474
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,203
And so
when you look at his photographs

475
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:55,791
you feel like you are in the photograph
with the animal.

476
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,879
I've had thousand-pound bears
sleep against my tripod,

477
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,631
which is also touching my leg.

478
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,343
Wild leopard seals come
up within two feet of me.

479
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,012
So that's
what makes Paul Nicklen

480
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,807
one of the greatest
photographers of our generation.

481
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,519
{\an8}He's shown us nature in a different way.

482
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,771
{\an8}That is intimate and really present.

483
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,941
{\an8}Mama and a little baby.

484
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,275
{\an8}Amazing.

485
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,402
{\an8}Oh my God, look at it!

486
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,737
{\an8}And then the next
dive is even closer and sharper.

487
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,322
{\an8}So, it was a good pass.

488
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,407
{\an8}- Those look great.
Yeah?

489
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,367
{\an8}Mom and a baby.
It's dreamy, right?

490
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,618
Very beautiful.

491
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,161
Dreamy backlight feel to it.

492
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,665
Nice! That's the reflection on top--

493
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,833
- Yeah.
- It's gorgeous.

494
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,880
There's an Inuit expression

495
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,424
that Paul taught me.

496
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:49,010
They say, "Tusu," which means
I am happy for what you have

497
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,804
but I want it for myself too.

498
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,514
So I have Tusu.

499
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:58,061
I think I had a lot of practice
finding my space next to someone

500
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,439
like Paul, because I was married
for 20 years

501
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,525
to Russ Mittermeier,
larger than life, adventurer,

502
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,110
explorer and scientist.

503
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,946
And the President of
Conservation International.

504
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,199
I had my first child when I was 23.

505
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,910
I was a very young mom.

506
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,998
You know, my grandmother
wanted me to have a baby.

507
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,333
I felt like this pressure, you know,
that it was time to have children.

508
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,004
Russ and I lived in Great Falls, Virginia,

509
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,715
which is an affluent
community near Washington DC.

510
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,967
So I, I started a little business.

511
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,719
Cristina Mittermeier Photography.

512
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,055
And so they wanted me to take
their picture for the holidays.

513
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,057
So I had them like on a rotation.

514
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,894
You know, I had this little spot
in front of the waterfalls.

515
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,938
And I had like three bookings
every afternoon.

516
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,650
So I had this little
business going making portraits.

517
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,445
At the same time, I was
going on these amazing trips

518
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:52,365
to the Amazon and to Papua New Guinea
with Russ and taking pictures.

519
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,328
He would go off at 5:00 in the morning
to chase monkeys.

520
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,580
And I had to stay
in these villages with the kids.

521
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,459
And having kids in remote communities,

522
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,671
it's like a magic door opener.

523
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,924
You know, people will
come out of their homes

524
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,842
and they just wanted to
touch these kid, you know,

525
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,261
and they would grab her
and before you know it,

526
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,263
you're in the middle of the family.

527
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,598
And I was like, "Holy!"

528
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,436
I had access to people's
very intimate spaces in life

529
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,104
and I could take pictures.

530
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,398
It was awesome.

531
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,444
And I was like, "Okay, game on."

532
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,654
You know?

533
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,948
We're sitting here on the northern Amazon,

534
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,742
waiting for some Indians coming to, uh,

535
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,452
do a welcoming dance for us.

536
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,955
So the funny thing is they came,

537
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,916
they went right by and they said,

538
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,292
"Oh, we'll come back. We'll come back."

539
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,002
So we're sitting here waiting for them.

540
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,593
She always surprises me.

541
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:58,306
There's always something
there that is just different

542
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,766
and beautiful and fresh.

543
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,979
Like what I can do with animals,
where I'm relaxed with them

544
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,981
and things happen for me with wildlife,

545
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,358
she's like that with people.

546
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,988
I've spoken
to women photographers

547
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,491
who think that being a woman
is a disadvantage.

548
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,868
For me, it was like a superpower,
you know?

549
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,413
You are just non-threatening, you know,

550
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,790
people don't care that you have a camera.

551
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,958
You're a woman.

552
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,294
And I realized, you know, if I focus on

553
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:30,380
this aspect of humans and nature,

554
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,882
maybe there's something
that not many people are doing.

555
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,177
And I think that's a very big difference

556
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,055
between male and female photographers, uh.

557
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,849
For me, it's about the relationships,
you know,

558
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,225
the photographs I want to make are about

559
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,853
the mother and the baby or the, you know,

560
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,313
the connection.

561
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,106
For a lot of the men,
it's about the action.

562
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,691
The bear, the shark!

563
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,156
{\an8}Directly off the stern.

564
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,824
{\an8}Right here off the stern, he just came up.

565
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,534
Wild tiger.

566
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,578
I didn't think we're going to see one.

567
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,705
Amazing.

568
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,756
Hey you guys hang on,
he's circling a stingray.

569
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,840
- Is he?
- Yeah.

570
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,050
- Are you kidding me?
- No, no.

571
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,010
- Whereabouts?
- Right under the drone.

572
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,970
That's pretty awesome.

573
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,308
Straight ahead.

574
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,769
Yep, right out in front of you.

575
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,437
Right towards those people.

576
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,689
Right here!

577
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,192
Swim this way! Circling back to you!

578
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,568
{\an8}Where's the shark?

579
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,445
{\an8}Right behind you guys.

580
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,072
On the far side of us.

581
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,574
10 feet, 15 feet.

582
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,046
That ray's tail's
been cut off.

583
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,130
Oh!

584
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,799
But he's about five feet long.

585
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,884
Do you
think that stingray is dying?

586
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:01,304
Yeah, I saw his eyes,

587
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,390
but they're just fully
covered over it, like fungus.

588
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,891
- Yeah.
- So that's why he can't see him.

589
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:08,937
And he, he
just moved 180, but very,

590
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,023
very slow and sluggish
and I just think it's a small shark.

591
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,650
I think it's terrified.

592
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,443
- Yeah.
- I mean, he's scared of me.

593
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,611
He's scared of this ray.

594
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,946
I mean, he's just cautious, right?

595
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,077
And we see tiger sharks
as these vicious beasts.

596
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,122
And yet they're patiently
waiting for a stingray that has

597
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,999
no barb to die rather than
risk getting hurt, you know.

598
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,754
Can you imagine that stingray?

599
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,298
Coming to this crossroads in time.

600
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,925
It's just, it's just very powerful.

601
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,802
It's, it's very fortunate.

602
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,179
It's sad. It's beautiful.
It's all of it, you know?

603
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,140
It's kind of how I want to go.

604
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,437
I've been always sort of
fascinated how I'm going to die.

605
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,899
I just don't want to die in a car
and I want my death to be cool.

606
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,737
I remember I was very close
to getting killed

607
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,114
by an 8,000-pound breeding elephant seal.

608
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,116
I didn't realize he'd been breeding
all day

609
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,951
and he was hot and he was in the water,

610
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,786
cooling off the water was four feet deep.

611
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,332
And I swam up to him to take
his picture and he turned on me

612
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,002
and here's an animal
that's when he rears up,

613
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,837
he's 11 feet tall in the air, you know,

614
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,298
and he's rearing up
and trying to crush me.

615
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,467
I'm the only defense I have.

616
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,260
Every time he tried to
bite me and his teeth are,

617
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,762
you know, four inches long.

618
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,264
I would just shove my housing
in his mouth and just push off

619
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,474
and I'm alone, you know.

620
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,642
And it was kind of calming.

621
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,686
I'm like, "So, this is
how I'm going to die."

622
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,980
I remember having that thought like,
"Oh, so this is it."

623
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,400
And, but finally, I took my,
my snorkel out of my mouth,

624
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,444
and I went, "Sean!" I yell,
put it back in my mouth.

625
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,529
Boom! And he just kept coming
after me, coming after me.

626
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,281
And finally, I crawled out in the beach,

627
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,034
but I, you know, my arms were
just swollen from the impact.

628
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,455
I think he has a very different

629
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,956
threshold for fear than I do,

630
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,710
so he is able to tolerate
a lot more risk than I can.

631
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,800
I just like
those raw moments where animals

632
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:06,638
are in control, I just feel very alive

633
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,140
when I'm vulnerable
and uncomfortable and a bit scared.

634
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,403
It was the first weekend in the Bahamas,

635
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,948
I was having quite a bit of regret,

636
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,575
I'm like, "I've just walked
away from the Arctic where

637
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:32,288
I do get to feel vulnerable
from the rawness of walrus

638
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,332
and ice diving and leopard seals."

639
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,042
And I was starting to question myself,

640
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,837
"I'm doing coral, in crystal blue water.

641
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,171
Like this is too easy.

642
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,674
I don't feel scared."

643
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,469
And then just as I was
having those thoughts,

644
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,221
we found the bottlenose dolphins.

645
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,390
And I jumped in the water
with one dolphin.

646
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,229
And then to witness
seven dolphins all diving deep

647
00:30:56,312 --> 00:31:00,608
into the sand and it looks like
you're flying over the moon

648
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,443
with all the craters,
it's called crater feeding.

649
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,948
And it became one of the most beautiful,

650
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,909
poetic moments of, of my career.

651
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,922
{\an8}And the tagline came up to me

652
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,967
{\an8}that this is the only drilling that
should be taking place in the Bahamas.

653
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,596
{\an8}

654
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,227
So what's our plan when we get

655
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,437
to the oil drilling?

656
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,566
I was saying that
when we get to the <i>Stena IceMAX,</i>

657
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,651
they're not going to let us hang out.

658
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,028
I don't think
they're going to invite us

659
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,446
on board for coffee, but I think that...

660
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,822
Oh,
I think they will unleash,

661
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,616
unleash their security boats on us.

662
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,744
So I think we have one chance and that is

663
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,954
pretending to be
a sailing cruising vessel,

664
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,833
film from the deck.

665
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,545
And as we pass, as we leave,
fly the drone before they come

666
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,880
and put the run on us.

667
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,840
They can't legally put
the run on us though.

668
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:06,925
Oh, they can

669
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,345
and they are protected
by the Bahamian government and--

670
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,347
No like we're not
going to be 50 feet from them.

671
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,848
We'll be half a mile from them.

672
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,767
Okay, just know that we risk getting

673
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,895
kicked out of the country
for harassing boat.

674
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,314
We're not harassing.
Just cruising by.

675
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,690
I'll leave it with you,

676
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,318
but I wouldn't hang out
because those ships,

677
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,779
you know, they are under threat of piracy

678
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:28,947
and terrorism and stuff.

679
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,204
You know, we very seldom fight.

680
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,500
I wish we had a more
healthy fighting life.

681
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,755
We don't fight, but we disagree.

682
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,632
So, then...

683
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,134
Going back to that
moment when you met Paul.

684
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,928
You were in the room for the first time.

685
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,805
What had brought you into that room?

686
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,059
So I was going to these

687
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,602
nature photography conferences.

688
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,771
Russ would keep the kids
and I would travel

689
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,148
to meet other photographers.
It was so intimidating.

690
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,776
'Cause they all had their portfolios
and these big binders.

691
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,027
And I had nothing.

692
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,862
I had 10 pictures of indigenous people

693
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,739
that nobody wanted to see.

694
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,659
So I was nobody, but I would raise my hand

695
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,411
and I would say, you know,

696
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,831
"Could we, you know,
perhaps think about contributing

697
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,834
more of our work to
environmental organizations?"

698
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,754
And I was basically told to
shut up and sit down, like,

699
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,923
"Yeah, we don't do
environment here little lady."

700
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,928
A lot of photographers had
a really hard time connecting

701
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,015
the dots between their work
and the conservation outcome.

702
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,226
I was trying to tell that story for them.

703
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,813
I was living
in White Horse, Yukon.

704
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,690
A friend of mine came over and he goes,

705
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:49,527
"There's this big organization
being launched, the ILCP,

706
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,571
the International League of
Conservation Photographers.

707
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,114
And, and this woman
named Christina Mittermeier is

708
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,782
launching it in Alaska.

709
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,492
And I'm going, I've been invited."

710
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,577
And I'm like, "Wow."

711
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,537
And I became sort
of instantly jealous and...

712
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,788
So I hadn't me her yet.

713
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,418
And then it was probably six,
seven months later, I was back

714
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,045
at <i>National Geographic</i> for meetings.

715
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:10,798
And, um, there was Cristina Mittermeier.

716
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,554
We were
in one of those meetings that

717
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,890
<i>National Geographic</i>
does for their photographers

718
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,975
and it was my first meeting.

719
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,060
She looked beautiful.

720
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:26,272
She's in this sort of Mexican,
the bracelets and the long skirt

721
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,774
and that very Mexican flair.

722
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,400
And there she is, looks just like, to me,

723
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,860
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

724
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,528
And there was an empty chair next to me.

725
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,780
And Paul walked in,

726
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,864
all Canadian.

727
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,283
He was wearing plaid and corduroys

728
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,367
and he was really cute.

729
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,328
And I was so nervous.

730
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,913
And she goes,
"Hello I'm Cristina Mittermeier.

731
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,748
I want you to sit next
to me and flirt with me."

732
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,666
Those are the first
words out of her mouth.

733
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,586
I've learned that she says
crazy things when she's nervous,

734
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:50,838
so she was nervous to meet me.
I was nervous to meet her.

735
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,591
By that time I knew that Russ and

736
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,842
I were not going to make it.

737
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,845
You know, it's one of those
where after you've been married

738
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,932
for about 15 years,
you start making a plan.

739
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,559
I was like, "You know what,
I'm still young.

740
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:07,855
I, I don't want to be here
10 years from now,

741
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,107
still feeling this way."

742
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,985
And Paul was on assignment in Mexico.

743
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:16,656
And I remember I was driving my kids
and I'm on my cell phone.

744
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,158
And, "Paul, Paul!" You know, I said,

745
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,828
"I need some of your pictures
for this press release."

746
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,246
And he said, "Talk to my agent."

747
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,250
And she's like, "Yeah,
Paul's going to need to be

748
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,334
paid for these."

749
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,418
Oh my God.

750
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,045
I was like, how can you call yourself

751
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,463
a conservation photographer

752
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,049
and you cannot even, you know,
allow the use of your images

753
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,134
for press release?

754
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,426
I was pissed. I was furious.

755
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,679
So I think in order to make it up to me,

756
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,807
he said that he would come
on an expedition,

757
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,101
we were documenting the Yucatan Peninsula

758
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,811
and just how quickly it's changed.

759
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,772
And so I put together a team
of 20 photographers.

760
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,607
I said, "I'll be Paul's assistant.

761
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,234
I'll pick him up from the airport."

762
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,487
And of all the photographers,
he was the most difficult

763
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,699
to work with because I knew
he didn't want to be there.

764
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,078
We ended up shooting together for a week

765
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,499
and diving in these
beautiful cenotes in Mexico.

766
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,628
There is something
really interesting that happens

767
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,463
when you dive with the same person.

768
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,466
And it is like a choreography,

769
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,302
it is like a dance.

770
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,888
When I was married to Russ Mittermeier,

771
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,931
he was so afraid of letting me dive

772
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,434
that I didn't dive almost in 20 years.

773
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,270
And so when I met Paul
and I started diving with him,

774
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,064
it was just like the most romantic,
amazing thing.

775
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:36,360
To have this dive partner
who loves to be underwater

776
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,486
as much as you do.

777
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,908
And we were staying
in a little house that we had rented

778
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,076
and I was like, "Oh my God, this is like,

779
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,494
we're in a honeymoon."

780
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,706
Hello, hello,
check, check one, two, three,

781
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,042
Cristina cooking Mexican tonight.

782
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,002
Happy birthday, to me.

783
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,337
Happy Birthday.

784
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,256
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

785
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,341
Cha, cha, cha.

786
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,010
<i>♪ Happy birthday to Christina ♪</i>

787
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,678
- I love you.
- Aww.

788
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:03,888
And many more.

789
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,097
I love you too.

790
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,808
And after we fell in love and, you know,

791
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,020
started working together,
I was his assistant in the field

792
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,480
and I was his fixer.

793
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,440
- Okay, one more.
- I'm very uncomfortable.

794
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,858
No, don't be uncomfortable,
get used to it.

795
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,193
He was
the photographer on assignment,

796
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,321
but I was traveling with him
and helping him with everything.

797
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,530
I'm gonna take your picture.

798
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,866
So we did probably 10 assignments for

799
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,034
<i>NatGeo</i> that way.

800
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,120
Just a dream
person to be out there with,

801
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,330
always happy and...

802
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,918
Just you know, I went from
loving working with her

803
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,878
to needing her in my life all the time.

804
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:39,173
And we went off on this journey together.

805
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,764
Paul was the first person to really

806
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,392
look at me and say, "Okay
you want to be a photographer."

807
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,813
Like until then I was fighting for it.

808
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,190
And he's like, "No, no,
you are photographer

809
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,733
and you're really good to."

810
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,153
It's amazing
when somebody says that to you.

811
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,327
So I brought her with me out on

812
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,998
a <i>National Geographic</i> assignment
and as I was standing there on

813
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:16,419
the shores, these two
photographers took me aside,

814
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,839
and they said, "We see
you're close to Cristina

815
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,173
like your friends," I'm like, "Yeah,"

816
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,675
and they said,
"We need you to go tell her that

817
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,510
she is not a photographer.

818
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,555
She is here in service to us."

819
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,517
That pissed me off.

820
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,437
I mean, there's like this

821
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,274
contract between a photographer
and an assistant.

822
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,483
You're not there to shoot.

823
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,360
You're there to facilitate his story.

824
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,154
No, I triggered some people, you know,

825
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,657
I trigger a certain kind of man,

826
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,119
a man who then has to
scold me or school me,

827
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,912
or tell me what's what.

828
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,123
They're all trying to bring her down

829
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,417
because photographers are like
a bunch of hungry wolves,

830
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,794
and I think being a Mexican woman living

831
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,672
in the United States,
she got a lot of that, you know?

832
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,424
Oh, yes.

833
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,010
Cristina, you're
the best president-elect I know.

834
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,429
{\an8}<i>Uh, uh...</i>

835
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,222
{\an8}I, I, I don't expect a recount.

836
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,728
I was just
so in awe of her determination

837
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,522
and power and perseverance
and her leadership,

838
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,858
and photographers were following her.

839
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,321
And my marriage had sort
of been over for many years.

840
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,156
It became just more of a decision,

841
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,867
I'm going to go do conservation, you know,

842
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,662
with this other woman
who's on fire, you know.

843
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,873
And we're going to go
fight for this planet.

844
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,625
That's all we're going to
do for the next 30 years.

845
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,964
I think
the biggest gift that Paul has

846
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,841
given me, he's been that confidence that,

847
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,220
that I do know what I'm doing
and I, maybe I am good at it.

848
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,347
Yesterday
you were an amazing Captain.

849
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,807
I captained it.

850
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,392
You did; you're captain.

851
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,494
Antarctica was a transformative

852
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,496
experience because for 10 years

853
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,082
I had been Paul's assistant and fixer.

854
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,334
And for Antarctica specifically,

855
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,713
Paul insisted that I be a photographer
on the expedition.

856
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,555
And I never wanted to be

857
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,348
a <i>National Geographic</i> photographer.

858
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,686
My ambition is to do conservation,

859
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,356
but it was like, "Wow, you know,

860
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,860
what a, an amazing privilege
and honor to be asked."

861
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:52,700
I was the only woman on the expedition
and I was kind of

862
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,828
half expecting for the men
to mansplain things to me

863
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,663
and tell me how to do things.

864
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,915
But they didn't, they were amazing.

865
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,876
They were like, "Okay Christina,

866
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,753
you're on splits, you're going
to be in the water all day.

867
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,005
See you at dinner."

868
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,757
You know? And I was like,
"Okay, I'm on my own."

869
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,260
It's fantastic.
You've got all these chicks.

870
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,928
These Chinstraps, Gentoos, Adélies.

871
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,515
They're all going to
sea right now, and, uh,

872
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,517
the leopard seals are here
to pick them off.

873
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,311
And they feed all morning
and then they rest all day.

874
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,494
I don't feel threatened

875
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,746
or scared in the company of animals.

876
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,873
So I have a very calm demeanor.

877
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,541
And I think that really helps.

878
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:46,003
And I spent about an hour
and a half first with one and then

879
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,463
with two, and at some point there were

880
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:52,718
five leopard seals around me,
wonderfully curious, photogenic,

881
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,220
super interesting animals.

882
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,597
And I was trying to
make a split photograph of

883
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,642
a leopard seal and an iceberg.

884
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,602
Guys, Peter. Good.

885
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,813
We need to
think about getting people out.

886
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,607
They're getting a little aggro.

887
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,693
Keith, time.

888
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,282
They come out of nowhere.

889
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,368
That's why I'm
yelling, "Incoming, incoming!"

890
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,870
Oh! It's like a ghost.

891
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,331
So beautiful.

892
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,416
Whoo!

893
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,753
- Yeah baby.
- Yeah baby!

894
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,423
- Well done guys.
- Well done guys.

895
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,259
Thanks, buddy.

896
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,510
Thank you.

897
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,804
That was awesome. That was unbelievable.

898
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,847
Life-changing really.

899
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,850
Hey you big girl.

900
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,561
You're beautiful.

901
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,814
So yesterday I was trying
to photograph this little

902
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,900
lonely penguin on the iceberg,
and as I was shooting there,

903
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,278
you know, all of a sudden
I saw one leopard seal come by

904
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,405
and then two leopard seals come by.

905
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,365
And pretty soon there were four or five.

906
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,325
So I want to try to do that again because

907
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,411
they were catching penguins right there.

908
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,662
You know, I got
a little concerned yesterday or

909
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,163
when I heard you were
in the water alone with

910
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,290
five leopard seals.

911
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,292
'Cause they are amazing animals.
They're like big dogs.

912
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,085
They're super cool.
There are a lot of fun.

913
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,878
They're the probably the most
beautiful animal you'll ever

914
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,506
watch underwater,
but five of them together.

915
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,217
I mean, they are,
they're nature's coolest killing machines.

916
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,469
I mean, they, one wants to mess with you.

917
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,887
Just, you know, be just be careful.

918
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,806
They, they seem to be pretty happy

919
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,808
eating penguins like popcorn.

920
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,852
Yeah.
There's a lot of food for them,

921
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,813
but still, it's not a given
that it's all going to go 100%.

922
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:35,029
I have almost lost Christina on
a dive once and it was a very,

923
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,782
it was just an awful
feeling like sickening.

924
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,536
And, um, you know,

925
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,874
so I, I think that my
safety barometer of that

926
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,293
gray line there, you push your limits of,

927
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,504
of what's right and wrong,
what's safe and not safe.

928
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,632
That line has come way down for me.

929
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,091
'Cause I look it through,

930
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,218
like, if I'm dead, I'm dead.

931
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,388
If I lose Christina,
then you have to live with that.

932
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,350
I'm always keeping an eye on her,

933
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:09,313
I never wanted to be sort of
patronizing or too protective of her,

934
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,606
but I'm very protective of her.

935
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,110
But, you know, who am I to say,
"I do this and you can't,"

936
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:16,987
you know, we're equal out there.

937
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,410
I'm very happy
that I was able to do that story.

938
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,621
Forevermore, I will be able to say that

939
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,790
{\an8}I'm a contributing photographer
to <i>National Geographic,</i>

940
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,583
{\an8}and that is a huge deal to me.

941
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:34,380
I now know that I am at the top
of my game and that I have what

942
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,508
it takes to produce the kinds
of stories that move people.

943
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:45,516
And I am happy that I get
to create this content now

944
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,435
for <i>SeaLegacy</i> and for this
conservation work that

945
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,770
I'm going to do until I die.

946
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,693
{\an8}Now we're
going to get into some of

947
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,152
{\an8}the nitty-gritty conservation work.

948
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,988
My understanding is we're 115 miles away

949
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,324
from the <i>IceMAX,</i> right
where they're drilling.

950
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,119
So are we going to come in
direct at the ship sort of hard

951
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,204
and fast, or are we going
to come in timid and shy from

952
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,206
the distance and get
some drones in the air?

953
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,541
{\an8}We could be there

954
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,501
{\an8}by 6:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

955
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,837
{\an8}We can come in just under
the cover of darkness

956
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,716
{\an8}tomorrow morning, even though
they legally can't ram us

957
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,260
or chase us out of there, they're
going to do everything they can

958
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,428
to get us out of there.

959
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,138
And then from there, our excuse,

960
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,806
"Oh, we're a Canadian boat, eh?

961
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,015
No like we're out here fishing.

962
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,144
And, um, we saw you have
a really cool boat and, um,

963
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,437
what are your distance restrictions?"

964
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,272
And they're going to be
like, "One mile," you know,

965
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,523
and you're like, "Okay, thank you.

966
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,275
We'll make sure we,
we follow those rules."

967
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,609
And we'll sit at a mile.

968
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,073
When you're starting out your
career you measure success

969
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:47,077
and it's nice to win a BBC Award
or a World Press Photo Award.

970
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,247
But after a while, you're like,
"Okay, I know how to tell a story."

971
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,876
And now we measure
success in having our own wins.

972
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,549
Whether it's taking on big oil in Norway,

973
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:04,052
I was in Moscow last year
and just like being glared down

974
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,305
by the entire oil industry from Norway.

975
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,807
If you've ever been to
a place called Lofoten,

976
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,852
it is truly one of the most
beautiful places in the world

977
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:15,647
where every year 1200 orcas
show up to feed on the herring.

978
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,816
You get humpback whales and fin whales.

979
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:22,196
We need to protect a lot of
these critical key habitats

980
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,282
on our earth if we want to continue
having life the way it is. Thank you.

981
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,950
They're staring at me while I'm on stage.

982
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:29,077
{\an8}And Putin had just given an address

983
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,205
{\an8}and just hating me because we had won.

984
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,124
We chased them out of these
grounds in the Lofoten region,

985
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,250
just using our cameras.

986
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:42,132
We had helped a group shut down
the entire drift net fishery

987
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,676
off the coast of California,
that has a nine-to-one bycatch

988
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,805
because we went diving
and showed how gross it is.

989
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,643
<i>Tragically, last night, we found
a humpback whale wrapped</i>

990
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,603
<i>up in this big, heavy crab pot line.</i>

991
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,480
<i>We were able to get a lot of it free,</i>

992
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:57,773
<i>but it still has a lot on it.</i>

993
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,566
<i>It's still out there
fighting for its life.</i>

994
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,652
We partner with these organizations

995
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,488
like this tiny nonprofit in Canada,

996
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,532
they literally are three people.

997
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,075
But they figured out a great idea.

998
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:11,370
{\an8}They said, "If we don't
want people to hunt wolves,

999
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,622
{\an8}all we have to do is
buy the hunting tenure."

1000
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:17,209
{\an8}You know, we just
rallied our followers we said,

1001
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,169
{\an8}"This is what we want to do
and this is how much we need,"

1002
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,463
and sure enough,
within days we had the money.

1003
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,548
{\an8}

1004
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,676
{\an8}And not ever again a single
wolf will be killed there.

1005
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:31,056
My dream is that
anybody sees SeaLegacy coming,

1006
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,891
not just the boat, but the organization.

1007
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,393
And they're just going to roll over.

1008
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:37,896
'Cause they just can't handle
300 million eyes, you know,

1009
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,649
something three times bigger
than eyes on the <i>Super Bowl,</i>

1010
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:43,151
all of a sudden focused on them
and what they're doing,

1011
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,486
that, that excites me.

1012
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,590
We have
been sailing through the night.

1013
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:08,969
And we are now 7.7 nautical miles

1014
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,596
away from the <i>Stena Ice.</i>

1015
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,891
We can see them in our radar
and they probably can

1016
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,684
see us in their radar.

1017
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,687
And they are probably wondering
what we are doing here.

1018
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:22,774
And so we need to come up with
an answer fairly, fairly pronto.

1019
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,906
Okay, coming down.

1020
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,330
Are you guys
ready for me to go into the wind?

1021
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,123
Yeah, standby,

1022
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,458
all right all sails down.

1023
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:40,792
Okay.

1024
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,297
{\an8}It looks like somebody just dropped
a frickin' chandelier right on the ocean.

1025
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,507
{\an8}- It's a city.
It's a city, yeah.

1026
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,717
It's a floating city.

1027
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:50,928
And the one thing that I don't want is

1028
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,679
to get kicked out of the Bahamas.

1029
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,015
To get reported to
the Bahamian authorities.

1030
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,600
I don't think we admit to journalists.

1031
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,936
We're just in transit, um.

1032
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,980
Looks like our C-O-G is, you know,

1033
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,399
two miles, that, is
that an acceptable distance?

1034
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,489
Are we close to, uh,
I want to change our course

1035
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:11,573
here pretty quick.

1036
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,081
So we are trying to already debate,

1037
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,749
we obviously don't already have
our plan completely together

1038
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,918
'cause Cristina now thinks we should issue
that we are journalists.

1039
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,295
And telling here to photograph the ship.

1040
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,756
I think that that's not smart.

1041
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,841
Um...

1042
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,802
Then they're going to get
really obviously suspicious.

1043
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,221
I'm going to alter course as
if we're going to miss them.

1044
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,641
I mean,
imagine the radio call going

1045
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:40,811
right now to the Bahamian Coast Guard.

1046
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,565
I, I think lying is not the best policy.

1047
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:49,611
I think it's just better to tell the truth
and see what they say.

1048
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:51,738
Do you really think you can get

1049
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,990
a great shot with a drone?

1050
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,534
You think two miles is, can get you there?

1051
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,285
What's, what's two miles in meters?

1052
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,121
- Three kilometers.
- Like three kilometers?

1053
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,330
3.2 kilometers.

1054
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,749
So it's like two is the, is as far,

1055
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,876
especially in like with
a bit of wind like this,

1056
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,921
you get there and have like
10 minutes to shoot that, man.

1057
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,840
My goal is that we have this,

1058
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:13,719
this angle 2.4 miles,
and by then we're going to be

1059
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:14,845
in radio contact.

1060
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,726
Too dark.

1061
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,102
<i>SeaLegacy One.</i>

1062
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,353
<i>SeaLegacy One.</i>

1063
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,272
- Paul you want to take that?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

1064
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,732
<i>This is Stena Icemax.</i>

1065
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,824
<i>IceMAX,
IceMAX,</i> yes, this is

1066
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,743
the <i>SeaLegacy One,</i> go ahead.

1067
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:41,246
<i>So, for information,</i>

1068
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,706
<i>we are a drilling rig.</i>

1069
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:46,084
<i>Our operations are
the only operations in this area.</i>

1070
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:49,463
<i>And we request a wide berth of at least
two nautical miles.</i>

1071
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,591
Yeah,
okay, Roger, copy that.

1072
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:56,553
We are, uh, just dealing with some sails,

1073
00:50:56,636 --> 00:51:00,974
and then we are going to
head to Cay Sal Bank, um.

1074
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,269
And then, um, but we will,

1075
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:06,354
we will maintain two nautical miles,

1076
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,274
we will give you a wide berth, um.

1077
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:10,400
And if there's, uh,

1078
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,569
come back to us 1, we'll stay on 1-6.

1079
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,997
<i>Yeah, okay Captain,
thank you very much. I appreciate that.</i>

1080
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,082
<i>Yeah.</i>

1081
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,334
Yeah, okay, copy.
Thank you.

1082
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,377
- Two miles.
- We got our number.

1083
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,463
- Okay.
- So that means 1.8.

1084
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,299
That's the number we wanted.

1085
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,759
Perfect.

1086
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,052
All right, this is it.

1087
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,872
You can barely see it behind me.

1088
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,332
Right above my head.

1089
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,042
There is this <i>Stena IceMAX.</i>

1090
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:12,796
It's a, an oil drilling ship
here in the southern waters

1091
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,297
of the Bahama.

1092
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:18,260
My hope is that there's no oil
and that they just

1093
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,594
give up and go home.

1094
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,765
But if they do find oil,
then we have to create a case

1095
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,434
for a better alternative.

1096
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:29,396
Building a blue economy,
a future that's more sustainable

1097
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:32,107
for Bahamians and for the world.

1098
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,067
I love the irony
that they have a polar bear

1099
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,402
with ice written on their ship.

1100
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:38,405
And this is the one thing
that's ultimately destroying

1101
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,990
the habitat of polar bears.

1102
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,117
You know, there's not much else we can do.

1103
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,453
We've already been issued
a two-mile alert by these guys.

1104
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,081
If we want to fly back and we want
to keep working in the Bahamas,

1105
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,584
I think we're going to have to be
respectful of that, unfortunately.

1106
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,464
So good.

1107
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,842
Wow, that is nice Shelton.

1108
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,636
- Well done.
- Gotta do like a...

1109
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,683
- It's kind of nice.
- Yeah.

1110
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,939
That shot right
there to me it says it all.

1111
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,693
It's actually in
many ways, it's the scariest.

1112
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:17,903
Yeah.

1113
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,696
This beautiful blue ocean, you know,

1114
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:22,782
look at the slick coming off the boat.

1115
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,784
Is that oil or is that sand or sediment?

1116
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,119
What is it?

1117
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,246
It's pretty shocking
that something that big

1118
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,373
is here, drilling.

1119
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:35,795
It's good.

1120
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,631
Very good, very proud.

1121
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,591
Everybody is going to love this.

1122
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,842
So good.

1123
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,305
Something that I always
find so impressive is just

1124
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:48,725
Paul's ability to execute
on expeditions, you know,

1125
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:52,395
to kind of visualize what
we need to do, plan for it.

1126
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:55,815
And then just put us in
the place where we need to be.

1127
00:53:56,358 --> 00:54:02,113
I think 99% of our success is just
Paul's experience with expeditions.

1128
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,324
I think of
like as tight as incriminating

1129
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,409
as possible without being illegal,
you know.

1130
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,663
That's powerful right there.

1131
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:10,747
Pull that,
pull that, pull that.

1132
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,249
That's nice.

1133
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,292
It's something like that,
where you look at the eyes.

1134
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,963
Okay.

1135
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,098
{\an8}
So I just received an email

1136
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:31,643
{\an8}from the president of <i>BREEF,</i> which is
one of the leading non-profits

1137
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:32,852
here in the Bahamas.

1138
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,355
They have been spearheading the effort

1139
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,482
to get, uh, oil drilling out of here.

1140
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:43,154
Whilst they will encounter oil,
commercial volumes of oils have

1141
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,782
not been proven at this well location.

1142
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,910
Drilling has now ceased
and the well will now

1143
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,371
be permanently plugged and abandoned.

1144
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,873
And we need to push now
for permanent protections

1145
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,667
from oil drilling in the future.

1146
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,336
This will send a message
to the world that we take

1147
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,505
the protection
of our environment seriously,

1148
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,590
that we care about the current and future

1149
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,134
well-being of our people.

1150
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:07,804
And that we are serious
about building a climate-resilient future

1151
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,515
and I think the country is celebrating.

1152
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,642
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1153
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,853
You never know
how these campaigns are going to go.

1154
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,730
You know, maybe we all get
to be heroes in this case,

1155
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,566
but we're going to keep
gathering the assets that

1156
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,735
allow us to keep that narrative on, uh,

1157
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,361
going in case they do
rear their heads again.

1158
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,575
{\an8}300,000 views in two hours.

1159
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:31,870
We're going to hit a million views
and probably 10,000 comments,

1160
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:34,664
which will be one of our more
successful engagement posts

1161
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,875
in a long time on something
that's really important.

1162
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,711
So people can sign petitions
and put their name and voice to it.

1163
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,629
And I think on a, on a bigger thing,

1164
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,257
you know, it keeps
feeding people with hope.

1165
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:45,925
Change is possible.

1166
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,177
Change is happening.

1167
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:00,565
Incredible, this is
what I need when I do splits.

1168
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,067
When you what?

1169
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,069
When I
do splits, this the kind of sky.

1170
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:07,614
It's all about the empty spaces
I learned once in a Sony video,

1171
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,158
that's where the magic
lives it's in the empty spaces.

1172
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,576
Are you making fun of me?

1173
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:19,000
But photographing four million years
of evolutionary perfection.

1174
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,126
That's...

1175
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,423
- It is very pretty.
- It is quite lovely.

1176
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:29,677
I've always been in awe of her
and definitely in love with her

1177
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,638
since the first time I met her, you know,

1178
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,640
when she said, "Come and sit next to me."

1179
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,523
Now she is one of the great
female photographers in the world.

1180
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,406
And I'm excited to see
what happens with her next.

1181
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,826
This is a great scene!

1182
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:58,289
I, I want to make stuff
that really transcends.

1183
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,708
Something bigger than itself.

1184
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,421
You know, compelling and poignant.

1185
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,715
It's the work that I am going to do

1186
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,844
because I have to,

1187
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,264
'cause how can I not?

1188
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:21,729
On my deathbed,
I just want to know that

1189
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:24,274
we saved a lot of habitat
and a lot of species.

1190
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,485
The more I go on this
journey with Cristina,

1191
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,863
and the more we have
the work with <i>SeaLegacy,</i>

1192
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:32,157
the more responsibility
I feel to tell stories.

1193
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,868
When you have the cameras,

1194
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:38,455
you get to control how the story ends.

1195
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,126
I think being out in the water

1196
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:46,880
and being a beacon of hope, of inspiration

1197
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,256
I think is really important.

1198
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:50,800
I don't want to move to Mars.

1199
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,887
I have no desire to go live
in a frickin' glass bubble.

1200
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,681
We are living in heaven,
to think that there's been

1201
00:57:56,764 --> 00:58:00,018
four billion years of
evolution to arrive at this

1202
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,519
moment of perfection where

1203
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,480
you know, this place is just beautiful.

1204
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,607
Where we can swim in crystal-clean water

1205
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,984
and you're surrounded by
grizzly bears and black bears

1206
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,694
and there's whales that come up to you.

1207
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:10,904
And it's here and now.

1208
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,539
We're just lucky we get to do this.

1209
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:22,707
We really are.

1210
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,667
This is, you don't retire from this.

1211
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,295
You know, you're with this
until, until you sign off.

1212
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,963
Until, you win or die, yeah.
