1
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,260
The only way you can change
the world is with stories.

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,517
{\an8}And the bigger your legend becomes,

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,602
the easier it is to share the story.

4
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,730
People want to hear it.

5
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,856
They want to listen.

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,735
<i>Winds to
35 knots or higher possible.</i>

7
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:27,902
<i>And thunderstorms.</i>

8
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,992
<i>Showers and thunderstorms.</i>

9
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,994
We are in an environmental emergency.

10
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,751
And having this vessel out there
telling these stories is

11
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,003
actually a really hopeful and inspiring.

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,017
It looks like somebody just
dropped a fricking

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,477
chandelier right on the ocean.

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,770
Yeah.

15
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:05,356
You don't realize the size
and the scale of this oil rig.

16
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,941
It's a floating city.

17
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,195
Now we're on this mission to chase big oil

18
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,279
out of the Bahamas.

19
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,157
Just using our cameras.

20
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,869
All right, this is it.
